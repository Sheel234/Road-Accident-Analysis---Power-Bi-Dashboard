# Road-Accident-Analysis---Power-Bi-Dashboard


#Project Summary

##1. Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze road accident data and identify patterns related to 

accident severity, frequency, and contributing factors (such as weather and road 

conditions). The dashboard is designed to help road safety authorities and policymakers 

make data-driven decisions to improve road safety and reduce accident fatalities.

##2. Key Insights & KPIs

The dashboard provides key performance indicators (KPIs) that give a quick overview of 

the current situation:

- Total Accidents: 263K total reported accidents.

- Fatal Accidents: 3,953 fatal accidents.

- Serious Accidents: 41K serious accidents.

- Slight Accidents: 263K slight accidents.

- Total Casualties: 351K casualties.

Percentage Breakdown (from Donut Chart):

- Slight Accidents – ~85%.

- Serious Accidents – ~13.23%.

- Fatal Accidents – ~1.77%.

##3. Visualizations

The dashboard contains multiple interactive visuals, including:

1. Top Junction Controls Contributing to Accidents – Bar chart showing accident counts by 

junction control.

2. Distribution of Accidents by Day of the Week – Column chart highlighting the most 

accident-prone days.

3. Accident Severity Distribution – Donut chart illustrating Fatal, Serious, and Slight 

accidents.

4. Weather Conditions vs. Accident Severity – Stacked column chart showing weather 

impact.

5. Number of Accidents Over Time – Line chart showing accident trends.

6. Road Surface Conditions vs. Accident Severity – Clustered bar chart for surface 

conditions.

7. Vehicle Type Analysis – Cards with accident counts by vehicle type (Cars, Bikes, Vans, 

etc.).

##4. Filters & Interactivity

The dashboard includes interactive slicers for Road Surface Conditions and Weather 

Conditions. Clicking on elements within charts dynamically filters the rest of the visuals for 

deeper insights.

##5. Insights

- Cars and bikes account for the majority of accidents.

- Fridays and mid-week days show higher accident frequency.

- Wet roads and foggy weather contribute to increased accident severity.

- Most accidents are classified as slight, but fatal accidents remain a critical safety concern.

##6. Dashboard Design

The dashboard layout includes:

- A top panel with KPIs (Total, Fatal, Serious, Slight Accidents, Total Casualties).

- Central charts for accident trends, severity, junction controls, and weather.

- A right panel showing vehicle type analysis with icons.

- Filters for Road Surface and Weather Conditions.
